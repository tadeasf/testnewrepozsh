# Hello World!

I am the future documentation that will get abandoned and sad. Like a forgotten cup of tea, I'll slowly turn cold as the enthusiasm of my creators wanes.

Remember to always document your code, or you might find yourself lost in a sea of confusion, much like Arthur Dent hitchhiking through the galaxy without his towel.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
